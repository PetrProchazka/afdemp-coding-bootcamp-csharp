# Week 07

Our aim is to develop a website similar to skroutz.gr (or scrooge.co.uk) limited to *technology* products.

Development of the website should start from an empty MVC project and will be separated into phases of advancing difficulty and complexity.

## Skroutz - Phase A
In Phase A, we only have **products**, **categories** and **stores**. Categories can have hierarchy, a product has only one category, and a store can sell many products and a product can be sold in many stores with different price.  
1. Create the model.  
2. Populate the database with seed data (c/p from original website if you like).  
3. Implement a Data Access Layer (DAL) exposing methods for common database actions.  
3. Create controllers and views for viewing/inserting/editing/deleting the model.
