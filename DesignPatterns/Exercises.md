# Design Patterns

## Exercise 1
### Observer Pattern

In the context of bootcamp course, there is a course, students, instructors, and organizers. The course has a start time and end time. If any of the timing changes, the stakeholders have to be notified. Implement a program that notifies the stakeholders whenever the time changes for the course.

## Exercise 2
### Strategy, Factory & Facade Patterns

Write a program to compute following metrics for C# code: 
* Lines of code
* Number of classes
* Number of methods 

1. Provide two ways to implement the same functionality: By using string comparison and by Regular Expressions. Pay attention to your design. *(hint: implement strategy and factory paterns)*
2. Extend the above program and implement a segregated interface to compute all the supported metrics. Write all the computed metrics to a CSV file. *(hint: use Facade pattern)*
