# Week 07


## Exercise 1
* In the context of bootcamp course, there is a course, students, instructors, and organizers.  
* The course has a start time and end time.  
* If any of the timing changes, the stakeholders have to be notified.  
Implement a program that notifies the stakeholders whenever the time changes for the course.


## Exercise 2
Write a utility class for reading a text file and writing to a text file.


## Exercise 3
Write a program to compute following metrics for a C# (or Java) code: LOC (Lines of Code), Number of classes, number of methods. Use regular expressions to achieve the same.


## Exercise 4
Provide another way to implement the same functionality but by using string comparison. Pay attension to your design (hint: implement strategy and factory paterns).


## Exercise 5
Extend the above program and implement a segregated interface to compute all the supported metrics. Write all the computed metrics to a CSV file (hint: use Facade pattern).
