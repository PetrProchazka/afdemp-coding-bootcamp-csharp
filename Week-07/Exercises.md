# Week 07

## Exercise 1
Write a program to compute following metrics for a C# (or Java) code: LOC (Lines of Code), Number of classes, number of methods. Use regular expressions to achieve the same.


## Exercise 2
Provide another way to implement the same functionality but by using string comparison. Pay attension to your design (hint: implement strategy and factory paterns).


## Exercise 3
Extend the above program and implement a segregated interface to compute all the supported metrics. Write all the computed metrics to a CSV file (hint: use Facade pattern).
